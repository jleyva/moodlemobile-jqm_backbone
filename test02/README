jQuery Mobile - Slide Menu Example
==============================================

This is a hardware accelerated slide menu example. I modeled it after Facebook's famous menu. Click the icon at the top left of the screen to expose the menu. You can also swipe left/right activate it. When the menu is exposed it resizes the data-role="page" container and is position absolutely above all other elements.
			
Note:
==============================================
Menu would work best in a Phonegap application with the device orientation locked to Portrait.
